## HTML FDA

Implementation of finite deterministic automata using pure HTML. States are HTML pages and transitions are hyperlinks. This is actually written in Markdown and converted/hosted by GitHub Pages. The only functionality used are pages and hyperlinks.

The following FDA are defined over the alphabet {0, 1}, including the empty string symbol ε to denote end of word for convenience.

- [Empty language (∅)](empty/s1.md)
- [Empty string](empty_string/s1.md)
- [0*](zstar/s1.md)
- [0\*1\*](zstarostar/s1.md)
- [Words containing even number of 0](even/s1.md)
